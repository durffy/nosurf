# scenario1
John Smith is a student at university-- he finds that he is unable to stay focused when studying due to browser based social media. With the desire to study, but stuck in a habit loop, John is unable to break the chain. He opens up his browser and he automatically types reddit.com, navigating to reddit.com/r/all-- seeing this he scrolls for hours without, only to realize he has wasted his time instead of studying as he originally intended

## Scenario 1: Activity 1
John smith opens up his browser and automatically types reddit.com. Upon entering, John gets a blocked site message with a list of tasks that he has previouly setup. Instead of going to reddit, he is able to identify the cue (opening the browser), replace the normal routine of browsing reddit with a relevant task list, and reward himself by processing the tasks he knows he needs to complete.

## Scenario 1: Activity 2
John Smith does not know exactly what sites he is wasting time on.. tbc
