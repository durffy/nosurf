# Scenario 1: Base Example
John Smith is a student at university-- he finds that he is unable to stay focused when studying due to browser based social media. With the desire to study, but stuck in a habit loop, John is unable to break the chain. He opens up his browser and he automatically types reddit.com, navigating to reddit.com/r/all-- seeing this he scrolls for hours without, only to realize he has wasted his time instead of studying as he originally intended

## Scenario 1: Activity 1 -- Blocking, and Task List
John smith opens up his browser and automatically types reddit.com. Upon entering, John gets a blocked site message with a list of tasks that he has previouly setup. Instead of going to reddit, he is able to identify the cue (opening the browser), replace the normal routine of browsing reddit with a relevant task list, and reward himself by processing the tasks he knows he needs to complete.

## Scenario 1: Activity 2 -- statistics
John Smith does not know exactly what sites he is wasting time on. He goes into the statistics view and see's that he spends the most time on youtube, amazon, and reddit. Right clicking on the site statistic, he is able to add to his block list, or his time limit list

## Senario 1: Activity 3 -- whitelisting
John Smith needs to access only specific website resources and not get distracted by the other things the site has to offer
John Smith opens up his browser and does a search for his research paper. In the search a relevant reddit.com link comes up. John is able to right click and add the link to his white list granting him access to the link for his research paper.
